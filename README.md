# CypherCrescent Software Development Academy - FOLLOW UP TEST 


## First Task
Write a program that converts a number in the range [0â€¦10000] to words,
corresponding to the English pronunciation.

constraints = [0, 10, 19, 37, 405, 1047, 4598]


## Second Task
Write a program that converts any number from one number base to another. The programme takes three inputs from a user: 
    Number to be converted, source base, and target base. The programme should also detect when a user inputs a number that is 
    invalid for a particular base. E.g. if the user tries to convert 12301 from base two to base eight.
